# Wine-Quality---Machine-Learning-Boosting-

In this project I used the Pandas, Seaborn, smote, and Machine Learning Boosting. 
Pandas is used for data loader and we can check if there is any null value in the data or not or it is also used to check 
the info of data and we can also get the many detail regarding the data. We can compare the different column of data 
and check the relation between them. 
Seaborn is mainly used to see the data in different graph form. In this project I use the countplot to see the quality 
column in graph. 
Smote is used to solve the imbalance problem in the data. When we split the data in x and y form then y output have 
mismatch data. So all y output data should be equal we use the smote. It help in Machine Learning. 
In this project the machine learning algorithms used is (Ada Boost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Light 
Boosting Gradient, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Cat Boosting Classifier). First we split the data in train and test form 
then we fit the x and y train data in algorithms and train the ML and after that predict the y output and then check the 
pred output with the original output with the use of the classification report we get the precision, recall, f1-score etc 
with this. We do this all five algorithm to check which one is best fit.
